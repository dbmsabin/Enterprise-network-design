# Enterprise Network Design â€“ University Assignment

A simulated enterprise network using Cisco Packet Tracer with HQ and 4 branch offices. Built to demonstrate real-world networking concepts and redundancy mechanisms.

---

## Topology Overview

- 1 HQ + 4 Branch Offices
- Redundant links and routers (HSRP)
- Switches with loop prevention (STP)
- Full IP addressing and subnetting plan
- Routed interconnectivity with static/dynamic routing

---

## Implemented Services

- **Email Server**
- **FTP Server**
- **DNS Server**
- **DHCP Server**
- **HSRP** (for gateway redundancy)
- **STP** (for loop avoidance)



## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Demonstrate understanding of end-to-end enterprise-level networking  
- Practice using Cisco Packet Tracer for real-world scenarios  
- Implement and verify routing, redundancy, and service-level configurations
